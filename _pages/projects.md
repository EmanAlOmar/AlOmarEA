## Completed Research Projects

**Self-affirmed Refactoring** (SAR): It refers to developers' documentation of their refactoring activities. SAR is key to understanding various aspects of refactoring, including the motivation, procedure, and consequences of the performed code change. All are documented by the code authors themselves.

This website contains all the research related to SAR. You will find all papers, artifacts, datasets, and scripts that we publicly share for replication and extension
