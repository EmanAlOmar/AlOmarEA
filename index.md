**I am in the job market!**


Hi, I am Eman and welcome to my academic space!

I am a PhD candidate at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/){:target="_blank"}, United States, working at the Department of Computing and Information Science 

I am interested in Software Engineering Research. My main focus of research is Software Maintenance and Refactoring. I developed a refactoring documentation taxonomy to aid the developers in following best documentation practices in order to improve their software development experiences.

For details about my research, please check my [publication list](/publications/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interests

I am interesting at the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- Software Engineering
- Software Maintenance & Evolution
