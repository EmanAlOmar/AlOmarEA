<!--**I am in the job market!**-->


Hi, I am Eman and welcome to my academic space!

I am an assistant professor at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/){:target="_blank"}, United States, working at the Department of Software Engineering. 

I am interested in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Research. My main focus of research is Software Maintenance and Refactoring. I developed a refactoring documentation taxonomy to aid the developers in following best documentation practices to improve their software development experiences.

For details about my research, please check my [publication list](https://emanalomar.github.io/AlOmarEA/publications/){:target="_blank"}.

## Research Interests

I am interested in the intersection of Software Engineering (SE) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- Software Engineering
- Software Maintenance & Evolution
- Empirical Software Engineering
- Mining Software Repositories
- Software Quality
- Software Refactoring
- Technical Debt
- Artificial Intelligence

**I always seek self-motivated, hard-working undergrad and grad students to join my team**. If you are interested, please look on my Google Scholar to see if you are passionate about any of these topics, then contact me.
